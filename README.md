# Portfolio

## The portfolio website features minimalistic design and is responsive.
The website is written in HTML, CSS and javascript. The idea of the program structure was that it should be easy to add new projects and categories. Therefore all data is read from a json-file. The website doesn't have to be reloaded any point - all content is dynamically appended to the DOM in javascript. Furthermore, the website is completely responsive and offers a different layout for smaller screens.
