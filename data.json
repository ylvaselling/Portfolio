The Monte Carlo raytracer makes use of a probability based method, the Monte Carlo method, to solve the rendering equation. The Monte Carlo method is used to simulate soft indirect light. Furthermore, Whitted raytracing is used to simulate transparent and specular surfaces. To reduce noise, supersampling and anti-aliasing was used. To minimise artefacts, a rays are terminated on a random basis which is called 'Russian roulette'.",
